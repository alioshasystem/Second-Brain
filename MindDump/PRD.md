- **Minimum iOS:** Version compatible with iPhone 11
- **Target Devices:** iPhone 11 and newer
- **Orientation:** Portrait only

### 4.2 Development Approach

- Follow standard Apple-recommended patterns and Human Interface Guidelines

### 4.3 Permissions Required

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Microphone | Voice dictation feature |

### 4.4 Data Model

  tags: [String]
  date: String (display format: "DD MMM")
  lastModified: String (display format: "DD Month YYYY, HH:MM AM/PM")
  promoted: Boolean
  priority: Int (0-4: 0=none, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high, 4=critical)
}
```

### 4.5 Local Storage

- Notes persisted locally on device
- No cloud sync required for MVP
- No authentication required for MVP

### 4.6 Voice Transcription

### 4.7 AI Integration Points (Future Reference)

The mockup suggests potential AI integration in these areas (not implemented in MVP):
- **Show Original:** Implies notes may have AI-processed versions
- **Make To-Do's:** Suggests AI extraction of action items from note content
- **Find Related Notes:** Semantic search/similarity matching
- **Transcribe (Link):** Possibly AI-powered URL content extraction

These are noted for future consideration only. No AI dependencies or implementation in MVP.
