Create a Pull Request to merge the current branch into **production**.

Steps:
1. Check git status and commit if there are uncommitted changes in spanish
2. Add all changes, commit with proper formatting ( IMPORTANT: don´t include Claude Code attribution)
3. Push to origin, never push to main, always to current branch
4. Analyze the changes and create a PR with `gh pr create --base production` with a Spanish title and description
5. Return the PR URL

Keep PR descriptions concise but informative. Categorize changes (UI/UX, Features, Fixes, etc.).
